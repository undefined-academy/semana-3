            <h1>Html</h1>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
                structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
                appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>

            <h1>Css</h1>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
                should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-browser environments also use it.</p>

            <h1>Web Components</h1>
            <p>Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements —
                with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web
                apps, s developers, we all know that reusing code as much as possible is a good idea. This has
                traditionally not been so easy for custom markup structures — think of the complex HTML (and
                associated style and script) you've sometimes had to write to render custom UI controls, and how
                using them multiple times can turn your page into a mess if you are not careful.</p>

            <h1>System Desing</h1>
            <p>System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system
                so that it meets the end-user requirements. System Design for tech interviews is something that
                can’t be ignored! Almost every IT giant whether it be Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple or any other
                ask various questions based on System Design concepts such as scalability, load-balancing, caching,
                etc. in the interview. This specifically designed System Design tutorial will help you to learn and
                master System Design concepts in the most efficient way from basics to advanced level.Understand the
                requirements: Before starting the design process, it is important to understand the requirements and
                constraints of the system. This includes gathering information about the problem space, performance
                requirements, scalability needs, and security concerns.
                Identify the major components: Identify the major components of the system and how they interact with
                each other. This includes determining the relationships between different components and how they
                contribute to the overall functionality of the system.
                Choose appropriate technology: Based on the requirements and components, choose the appropriate
                technology to implement the system. This may involve choosing hardware and software platforms.</p>
